Okay, so I've flooded you with a bunch of readings lately, and I should give you a rough
guide to the readings. Here's how I would start: 

* Read the Appendix from Culp.
* Read McDonald Chapter 2 (sections 2.1 - 2.4 only)
* Read McDonald Chapter 5 (sections 5.1 - 5.4 only)
* Re-read McDonald Chapter 9 (sections 9.1 and 9.2)

Thanks for coming on this journey with me through modeling derivatives markets.

Cheers!
