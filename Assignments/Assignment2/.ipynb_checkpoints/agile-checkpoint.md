Instructions 
============

This assignment is administered as a team project. To complete the project you
will implement Scrum, which is a framework for team projects. In Scrum,
teams act autonomously to complete the project.

Team Roles 
----------

There are only a few roles in Scrum:

-   **Scrum Master (SM):** is responsible for helping the team to
    operate efficiently. The SM is like a player-coach. The SM runs the
    Sprint Planning and Demonstration meetings (see below). The SM's
    main job is to remove obstacles from the team during Sprints (see
    below). The SM is responsible for communicating with the Professor.
    The SM is also a regular Team Member. The team decides upon a means
    to elect their SM.

-   **Product Owner (PO):** is responsible for maintaining the **Product
    Backlog** and **Scrum Board** (see below). The PO is also a regular
    TM. The team decides upon a means to elect their PO.

-   **Team Members (TM):** are responsible for helping the team to
    achieve its goals as set out in the Sprint Planning meeting. Each TM
    has an equal vote (including the SM and PO).

-   **Stakeholders (SH):** is the party to whom the team is responsible
    for completing the project. In this case, the Professor is the
    single SH.

Sprints 
-------

In Scrum, the team works in time boxes called Sprints. This is a set
amount of time, during which the team works to accomplish tasks from the
Product Backlog. Each Sprint begins with a Sprint Planning Meeting.
During this meeting the team votes on items from the Product Backlog to
complete. The idea is to learn how fast the team can work to accomplish
their work. At the end of the Sprint a Sprint Demonstration Meeting is
held, during which TM's demonstrate the items they completed. The SM
facilitates both of these meetings, but all TMs have an equal voice/vote.
The SM's job is to review obstacles from TM's during the Sprint
Demonstration Meeting and devise a means to help remove those obstacles
during the next Sprint. In this way the team achieves acceleration in
the amount of work they can accomplish. In this way, it is meant to be
an adaptive group learning framework. The team's **Velocity** is the
amount of work that can be accomplished during a given sprint.

During the **Sprint Planning Meeting** the team should vote on items
from the Product Backlog that they think they can complete during the
Sprint. Individual TM's take upon themselves the responsibility for
specific items from the Product Backlog. The PO keeps track of which TM
is assigned which specific task. Each specific task should also have an
agreed upon definition of what it means to be completed. This meeting
should be no longer than required (I would guess about 45 minutes to an
hour). Any longer than this and the team tends to lose focus. It is the
responsibility of the SM to keep the meeting on point.

During the **Sprint** the team carries out the work to accomplish the
assigned tasks. I recommend sprints of 2-4 days. If they are too short
it is hard to complete any meaningful work. If they are too long it is
difficult to improve the team's velocity.

At the end of the sprint the team holds a **Sprint Demonstration
Meeting**, during which the TM's show their completed work. The SM asks
questions to find out what obstacles stood in the way of TM's in
completing their specific tasks. The team then discusses how those
obstacles can be removed. What resources can be brought in to help? What
methods can be used to help TM's be more efficient? It is essential that
TM's be honest and open regarding their performance during the sprint so
that the SM can help plan how to improve during the next sprint. At
least two items should be added to the Product Backlog regarding how the
team can improve velocity and be incorporated into the next sprint. The
next sprint is then planned.

The team should assign a point value to each task chosen from the
Product Backlog to be included in a give sprint. The team can use
whichever metric they like, but I suggest the Fibonacci method. See the
Wikipedia article for more information on Fibonacci numbers: 0.75em
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>. This method assigns a
$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots$ to each task. Each TM should place a
specific number on each task. The SM should tally the points. If there
is significant disagreement as to the point value of a specific task
(e.g. one TM votes an 8 and another TM votes a 21) then the team should
discuss the reasons for the disagreement. After discussion another vote
should be taken until there is convergence. If disagreement is small
(e.g. one TM votes a 5 and another TM votes an 8) then the average point
value should be taken. The number of points that a team can accomplish
during a given sprint defines the velocity.

Daily Stand-Up Meetings 
-----------------------

During a given sprint, the team should hold brief (no more than 20
minutes) **Daily Stand-up Meetings** to discuss progress towards the
sprint goal. These meetings can be face-to-face or online. Use whatever
technology facilitates this, such as Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts, etc.
Stand-up meetings could be asynchronous, but synchronous meetings are to
be preferred if possible.

During the stand-up meetings each TM should answer three succinct
questions:

-   **Question 1:** What did you do yesterday to help the team finish
    the sprint?

-   **Question 2:** What will you do today to help the team finish the
    sprint?

-   **Question 3:** Is there any obstacle blocking you or the team from
    finishing the Sprint Goal?

The phrasing of the questions assumes that the meeting is held each
morning. You can adapt them to your situation. The SM facilitates the
meeting and ensures that the time limit is obeyed. The SM makes note of
any obstacles noted.

The Nuclear Option 
------------------

To make sure that each TM contributes meaningfully to the effort there
is a **Nuclear Option** in place. That is, after two team sprints if a
TM is not completing their tasks the team may vote to drop the TM from
the team. As the name suggests, this should be a rare and extreme
situation. It certainly does not need to be exercised, and if a team is
operating properly it never will be during the life of the project. If the
option is exercised, the SM must send an email to the Stakeholder (the
Professor) and the TM that is being dropped and outline the team's
decision.

A TM who is dropped by the exercise of the nuclear option must seek to
join another team of drop-outs or complete the project alone.

The Deliverables 
----------------

The team should maintain a **Scrum Board** throughout the project. The PO 
is responsible for the Product Backlog and the Scrum Board. You can use 
whatever you like for these, but I suggest that you make a master 
Product Backlog (with color-coded cells, etc) in a shared Google Drive 
with Google Sheets. Then maintain a team Scrum Board with Trello (which
has both web and mobile apps). If you decide to use Trello just use the
free version. No need to pay any for a premium account. Your Scrum Board
should have columns such as Ready, Doing, Done. But you can customize it 
however you like as a team. The PO will then migrate tasks from the
Product Backlog sheet to the Scrum Board. 

The team should hand in a single Jupyter Notebook with answers to the
project questions. Answers should use Markdown Cells for plain English
answers and Code Cells for Python code. You may wish to have some code in 
an accompanying (i.e. "imported") module to keep things clean. 

The SM may decide to use a Google Doc or a Markdown document to keep notes
for meetings to keep a record throughout the project.

All of these documents should be in a shared Github repository. The PO
should invite the Stakeholder to the team repo and Scrum Board.
